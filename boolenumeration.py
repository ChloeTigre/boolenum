"""
abstraction of a boolean enumeration problem. such problems are meant to get a
single character's value in a blind system such as a blind SQLi injection.

* wanted_data_coordinates is a tuple defining the /coordinates/ of data we want 
(bound to implementation of the connector). For example a SQL boolean enumerator
will want to define it as (table_fully_qualified_path, row, column, character)

* connector enables sending the boolean enumeration queries to the data source.
It is a target-specific class with facilities to send truth tests to the target.
It exposes a send_message method that returns a response state. The caller (for
example a tester) can then analyze the response state and deduce if an assertion
is true or false (time-based attacks, presence or absence of a stringâ€¦)

Truth tester prototype. It takes a connector's output and can tell whether its
assertion is true or false.

"""
prototype of a boolean enumeration tester. It is fed with problems and it gives
results. It is generic and needs not be extended usually.

It uses in this implementation a greater-than / less-than-or-equal testing. If
you cannot get these truths then implement it with lt / ge testing.

We are testing values in the range 0-255 because these are the possible values
for a byte. However in cases where another continuous finite number of integer
values are possible this would need to be adjusted accordingly.

We use the efficient bisection (binary search) algorithm to guess the value.
